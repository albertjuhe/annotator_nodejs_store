                              family is one of the most distinguished of that republic. My ancestors
                              had been for many years counsellors and syndics, and my father had
                              filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was
                              respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable
                              attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually
                              occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had
                              prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life
                              that he became a husband and the father of a family. </div>
                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b5">As the circumstances of his marriage
                              illustrate his character, I cannot refrain from relating them. One of
                              his most intimate friends was a merchant who, from a flourishing
                              state, fell, through numerous mischances, into poverty. This man,
                              whose name was Beaufort, was of a proud and unbending disposition and
                              could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country
                              where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and
                              magnificence. Having paid his debts, therefore, in the most honourable
                              manner, he retreated with his daughter to the town of Lucerne, where
                              he lived unknown and in wretchedness. My father loved Beaufort with
                              the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these
                              unfortunate circumstances. He bitterly deplored the false pride which
                              led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that
                              united them. He lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out, with the
                              hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and
                              assistance. Beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself,
                              and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed
                              at this discovery, he hastened to the house, which was situated in a
                              mean street near the Reuss. But when he entered, misery and despair
                              alone welcomed him. Beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money
                              from the wreck of his fortunes, but it was sufficient to provide him
                              with sustenance for some months, and in the meantime he hoped to
                              procure some respectable employment in a merchant's house. The
                              interval was, consequently, spent in inaction; his grief only became
                              more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection, and at
                              length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three
                              months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion. </div>
                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b7"> His daughter attended him with the
                              greatest tenderness, but she saw with despair that their little fund
                              was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of
                              support. But Caroline Beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould,
                              and her courage rose to support her in her adversity. She procured
                              plain work; she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a
                              pittance scarcely sufficient to support life. </div>

                              Her father grew worse; her time was more entirely occupied in
                              attending him; her means of subsistence decreased; and in the tenth
                              month her father died in her arms, leaving her an orphan and a beggar.
                              This last blow overcame her, and she knelt by Beaufort's coffin
                              weeping bitterly, when my father entered the chamber. He came like a
                              protecting spirit to the poor girl, who committed herself to his care;
                              and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to Geneva and
                              placed her under the protection of a relation. Two years after this
                              event Caroline became his wife. </div>
                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b9c13"> There was a considerable difference
                              between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite
                              them only closer in bonds of devoted affection. There was a sense of
                              justice in my father's upright mind which rendered it necessary that
                              he should approve highly to love strongly. Perhaps during former years
                              he had suffered from the late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved
                              and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth. There was a
                              show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother,
                              differing wholly from the doting fondness of age, for it was inspired
                              by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some
                              degree, recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured, but which
                              gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her. Everything was made
                              to yield to her wishes and her convenience. He strove to shelter her,
                              as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind
                              and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable
                              emotion in her soft and benevolent mind. Her health, and even the
                              tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit, had been shaken by what
                              she had gone through. During the two years that had elapsed previous
                              to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public
                              functions; and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant
                              climate of Italy, and the change of scene and interest attendant on a
                              tour through that land of wonders, as a restorative for her weakened
                              frame. </div>

                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b9c27b3"> From Italy they visited Germany
                              and France. I, their eldest child, was born at Naples, and as an
                              infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained for several years
                              their only child. Much as they were attached to each other, they
                              seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of
                              love to bestow them upon me. My mother's tender caresses and my
                              father's smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first
                              recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something
                              better--their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
                              them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was
                              in their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they
                              fulfilled their duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of
                              what they owed towards the being to which they had given life, added
                              to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both, it may be
                              imagined that while during every hour of my infant life I received a
                              lesson of patience, of charity, and of self-control, I was so guided
                              by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me. For
                              a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have
                              a daughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about
                              five years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of
                              Italy, they passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their
                              benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor.
                              This, to my mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
                              passion--remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
                              relieved--for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
                              afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a
                              vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while
                              the number of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury
                              in its worst shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to
                              Milan, my mother, accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a
                              peasant and his wife, hard working, bent down by care and labour,
                              distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes. Among these there was
                              one which attracted my mother far above all the rest. She appeared of
                              a different stock. The four others were dark-eyed, hardy little
                              vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her hair was the
                              brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her clothing, seemed
                              to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was clear and
                              ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of her
                              face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
                              her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being
                              heaven-sent, and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features. The
                              peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
                              admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She
                              was not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother
                              was a German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been
                              placed with these good people to nurse: they were better off then.
                              They had not been long married, and their eldest child was but just
                              born. The father of their charge was one of those Italians nursed in
                              the memory of the antique glory of Italy--one among the schiavi ognor
                              frementi, who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He
                              became the victim of its weakness. Whether he had died or still

                              confiscated; his child became an orphan and a beggar. She continued
                              with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode, fairer than a
                              garden rose among dark-leaved brambles. When my father returned from
                              Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child
                              fairer than pictured cherub--a creature who seemed to shed radiance
                              from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the
                              chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his
                              permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
                              charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had
                              seemed a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her
                              in poverty and want when Providence afforded her such powerful
                              protection. They consulted their village priest, and the result was
                              that Elizabeth Lavenza became the inmate of my parents' house--my more
                              than sister--the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations
                              and my pleasures.</div>

                              passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded
                              her became, while I shared it, my pride and my delight. On the evening
                              previous to her being brought to my home, my mother had said
                              playfully, "I have a pretty present for my Victor--tomorrow he shall
                              have it." And when, on the morrow, she presented Elizabeth to me as
                              her promised gift, I, with childish seriousness, interpreted her words
                              literally and looked upon Elizabeth as mine--mine to protect, love,
                              and cherish. All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a
                              possession of my own. We called each other familiarly by the name of
                              cousin. No word, no expression could body forth the kind of relation
                              in which she stood to me--my more than sister, since till death she
                              was to be mine only. </div>

                              our ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of
                              disunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
                              the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
                              nearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
                              disposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense
                              application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.

                              tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
                              our Alpine summers--she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
                              While my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
                              magnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their
                              causes.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.
                              Curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
                              gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
                              earliest sensations I can remember. </div>
                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b5b59">On the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
                              up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
                              country.  We possessed a house in Geneva, and a campagne on Belrive,
                              the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
                              league from the city.  We resided principally in the latter, and the
                              lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion.  It was my
                              temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few.  I was
                              indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united
                              myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them.  Henry
                              Clerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva.  He was a boy of singular
                              talent and fancy.  He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
                              its own sake.  He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He
                              composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
                              knightly adventure.  He tried to make us act plays and to enter into
                              masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
                              Roncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous
                              train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
                              of the infidels. </div>

                              their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
                              which we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly
                              discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted

                              but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
                              indiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,
                              nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
                              possessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth

                              and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
                              to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
                              gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul
                              of Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
                              Her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
                              her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.  She was
                              the living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become

                              adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
                              beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring

                              visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon
                              self.  Besides, in drawing the picture of my early days, I also record
                              those events which led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of
                              misery, for when I would account to myself for the birth of that
                              passion which afterwards ruled my destiny I find it arise, like a
                              mountain river, from ignoble and almost forgotten sources; but,
                              swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent which, in its course,
                              has swept away all my hopes and joys.  Natural philosophy is the genius
                              that has regulated my fate; I desire, therefore, in this narration, to
                              state those facts which led to my predilection for that science.  When
                              I was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the
                              baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a
                              day confined to the inn.  In this house I chanced to find a volume of
                              the works of Cornelius Agrippa.  I opened it with apathy; the theory
                              which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he
                              relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm.  A new light seemed
                              to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my
                              discovery to my father.  My father looked carelessly at the title page
                              of my book and said, "Ah!  Cornelius Agrippa!  My dear Victor, do not
                              waste your time upon this; it is sad trash."</div>
                           <div class="para" id="w26aab5b9c27b91">If, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to
                              me that the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a
                              modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much
                              greater powers than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were
                              chimerical, while those of the former were real and practical, under
                              such circumstances I should certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and
                              have contented my imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with
                              greater ardour to my former studies.  It is even possible that the
                              train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led
                              to my ruin.  But the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by
                              no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents, and I
                              continued to read with the greatest avidity.  When I returned home my
                              first care was to procure the whole works of this author, and
                              afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus.  I read and studied the
                              wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
                              treasures known to few besides myself.  I have described myself as
                              always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the
                              secrets of nature.  In spite of the intense labour and wonderful
                              discoveries of modern philosophers, I always came from my studies
                              discontented and unsatisfied.  Sir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed
                              that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and
                              unexplored ocean of truth.  Those of his successors in each branch of
                              natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted appeared even to my boy's
                              apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit.
                              <br/><br/>
                              The untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
                              with their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little
                              more.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal
                              lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,
                              anatomize, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
                              in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I
                              had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
                              human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
                              ignorantly I had repined.
                              <br/><br/>
                              But here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and
                              knew more.  I took their word for all that they averred, and I became
                              their disciple.  It may appear strange that such should arise in the
                              eighteenth century; but while I followed the routine of education in
                              the schools of Geneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with
                              regard to my favourite studies.  My father was not scientific, and I
                              was left to struggle with a child's blindness, added to a student's
                              thirst for knowledge.  Under the guidance of my new preceptors I
                              entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the
                              philosopher's stone and the elixir of life; but the latter soon
                              obtained my undivided attention.  Wealth was an inferior object, but
                              what glory would attend the discovery if I could banish disease from
                              the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death!
                              Nor were these my only visions.  The raising of ghosts or devils was a
                              promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of
                              which I most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always
                              unsuccessful, I attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience
                              and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors.  And
                              thus for a time I was occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an
                              unadept, a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately
                              in a very slough of multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent
                              imagination and childish reasoning, till an accident again changed the
                              current of my ideas.  When I was about fifteen years old we had retired
                              to our house near Belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and
                              terrible thunderstorm.  It advanced from behind the mountains of Jura,
                              and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various
                              quarters of the heavens.  I remained, while the storm lasted, watching
                              its progress with curiosity and delight.  As I stood at the door, on a
                              sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak
                              which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so soon as the
                              dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing remained
                              but a blasted stump.  When we visited it the next morning, we found the
                              tree shattered in a singular manner.  It was not splintered by the
                              shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood.  I never beheld
                              anything so utterly destroyed.
                              <br/><br/>
                              Before this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
                              electricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural
                              philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
                              the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
                              electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
                              All that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,
                              Albertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
                              some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
                              accustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
                              be known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
                              despicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
                              most subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former
                              occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
                              and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
                              would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
                              real knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the
                              mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
                              being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.
                              <br/><br/>
                              Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
                              are we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me
                              as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
                              immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life--the last effort
                              made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
                              then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was
                              announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
                              followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
                              studies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with
                              their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.
                              <br/><br/>
                              It was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
                              Destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
                              terrible destruction.</div>
